## Technical Requirements

*Excelling* - Your app makes good use of the fundamentals of Rails, plus the
additional API technology.

## Creativity and Interface

*Performing* - Your app has an OK interface for the functionality provided, but
there's certainly some room for improvement. Some quick wins: the UX for adding
an account is confusing... the box implies I should include the `@`, but it
seems like I have to omit it for it to work. Additionally, it's not clear
what the difference is between the two feeds on the main page... I'd suggest
simplifying or adding headings to clarify. Other UX wins would be things like
converting links to clickable links, converting time stamps to relative time, etc.

## Code Quality

*Performing* - Please see my inline comments for more detail.

## Deployment and Functionality

*Performing* - Your app has a good amount of functionality for a P2, and the
deployed version seems to work just one. One note... the add expects to have
at least one account in the DB before it can run the server... suggest
clarifying that, or providing a seed script to add at least one account.

## Planning / Process / Submission

*Progressing* - Your Readme is a good, your user stories are OK (could be a bit
more specific, and have them grouped into sections of bronze/silver/gold, etc)
... but your app currently doesn't have any wireframes or ERDs. They may not
be the most important thing for an app of this scope, but they are critical for
developing / maintaining our apps as they grow in size.
